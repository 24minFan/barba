- Find correct open source license
  - anyone can do what they want, but:
    - they can't resell it as it is
    - I have the right in any moment to not allow a specific use

- Implement unit tests + e2e tests (puppetteer?)
- Documentation automatic or manual?
- When build for production (+ npm push), update the file gzip in website and readme
