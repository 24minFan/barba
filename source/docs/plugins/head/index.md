# @barba/head

## Coming soon!

Keep your `<head>` up to date.

This plugin will help you **update the `<head>` tag** to automatically load missing styles/scripts, depending on the next page content.

> For now, you can use `beforeEnter` hook to inject resource using `<link>`, see issue https://github.com/barbajs/barba/issues/410 for more details.
