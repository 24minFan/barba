# Todos

- Find correct open source license
    - anyone can do what they want, but:
        - they can't resell it as it is
        - I have the right in any moment to not allow a specific use
- Implement unit tests + e2e tests (puppetteer? / cypress?)
- Documentation automatic or manual?
- When build for production (+ npm push), update the file gzip in website and readme
    - use conventional commits/changelog with some automation
